5.  _Responsive Design:_ This webpage was developed to be optimized for all devices, including desktop, tablet, and mobile to ensure that it looks acceptable and functions seamlessly across all devices.

**Target Audience:**
The Target audience for my portfolio is potential employers, and clients.
It is a way for me to showcase my skills, and continually update my portfolio as I continue to develop my skills and build more projects.
This portfolio may be viewed by anyone who is interested in assessing my skills, experience, or who may wish to contact me.

**Tech Stack:**
The tech stack used in this project was HTML, and SCSS.
This project was deployed using Netlify.

The design aspect of this project was completed using Draw.io to develop the sitemap, and Figma to develop the wireframe and design the proposed look of the webpage at mobile, tablet, and desktop views.

Sitemap

At the start of my design process I wanted to have my navbar at the bottom of the page and use one long continous page to scroll through all the sections of my portfolio.
Here are some images of my original design

Old Wireframe Design

As I started implementing my design into code, I had a change of mind and decided I would rather use a header with my navbar at the top and a footer with my social media links on every page.
I also made some minor changes to the layout and changed my 'projects' page to a 'blogs' page.
